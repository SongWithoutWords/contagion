For this milestones you should continue to support all required skeletal game features. You
should augment those with core gameplay logic, incorporate additional assets and features that
allow for non-repetitive gameplay, introduce basic user help, and perform playability testing.
(75%) Milestone requirements:
- Sustain progressive, non-repetitive gameplay using all required features for 2 min or
more (assume that you can provide users with oral instruction).
- You should implement state and decision tree driven (possibly randomized) response to
user input and game state (create a decision tree data structure and reuse it for multiple
entities)
- Provide extended sprite and background assets set as well as corresponding actions.
- Provide basic user tutorial/help.
- Stable game code supporting continuing execution and graceful termination.
(25%) Creative: You should implement one or more additional creative elements. These can
include additional assets, rendering effects, complex gameplay logic, or pre-emptive
implementation of one or more features from subsequent milestones.

* PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT PLAN *
- Presentation with basic sprites
- Basic game setup (main menu, frontend UI flow)
- A basic city map with static structures
- Collision detection between entities and static structures
- Pathfinding of entities around static structures
- Can band-select and issue orders to multiple police, or double-click to select all police on screen
- Can issue specific attack orders to individual police

* PLANNED FEATURES NOT DELIVERED *
- Basic game setup (main menu)
- Can issue specific attack orders to individual police (We don't currently have any specific attack orders)

* COMPLETED PLANNED FEATURES FROM SKELETAL GAME DELIVERABLE*
- Zoom into and out of cursor

* ADDITIONAL FEATURES DELIVERED *
- Graceful termination
- Sustain progressive, non-repetitive gameplay using all required features for 2 min
- GUI structure and rendering(HUD, menu)
- Text rendering
- Controls for menu
- Fully implemented code for handling Audio (200+ sound effects can be played concurrently)
- Cops take an exponentially distributed amount of time to aim at their target (gunfire sounds more realistic this way than with log-normal distribution)
- Bullets fire with a random angular deviation that is normally distributed
- Gunshots eject bullet casings which are subject to velocity and drag
- Display sprites for bullets in flight
- Cops do not aim or fire through buildings
