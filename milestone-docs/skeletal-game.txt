* MILESTONE REQUIREMENTS *
For this milestone you should have a basic game of comparable complexity to the “Hello World”
assignment. This should include basic rendering, input-driven response, basic 2D motion, basic
event-driven/random response, and a minimal set of assets.
(75%) Milestone requirements:
- Working application rendering code and shaders for background and sprite assets
- Loading and rendering of textured geometry with correct blending.
- Working basic 2D transformations.
- Keyboard/mouse control of one or more character sprites. This can include changes in the
set of rendered objects, object geometry, position, orientation, textures, colors, and other
attributes.
- Random or hard-coded action of (other) characters/assets.
- Basic key-frame/state interpolation (smooth movement from point A to point B in
Cartesian or angle space).
- Stable game code supporting continuing execution and graceful termination.
(25%) Creative: You should implement one or more additional creative elements. These can
include additional integrated assets or rendering effects or pre-emptive implementation of one or
more features from subsequent milestones.
Your submission should align with your proposed development plan: Provide a write-up
explaining how your milestone aligns with the plan. Explain all discrepancies.

* PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT PLAN *
- Core data types (vectors, matrices, random number generation, etc.)
- Basic simulation (entities with mass, acceleration, drag)
- Pause/stop/restart
- Collision between entities
- Zombies chase civilians and police
- Civilians flee zombies
- Police shoot zombies
- Collision between entities and projectiles
- Basic presentation (rendering of entities, may just be shapes)
- Initial work on camera
  - Pan with acceleration/drag
  - Zoom into and out of cursor
- Random seeding of infected citizens at beginning of game
- Can select and issue movement orders to individual police

* PLANNED FEATURES NOT DELIVERED *
- Zoom into and out of cursor

* ADDITIONAL FEATURES DELIVERED *
- Ambient audio
- Visual highlight of selected entities (police)
- Smooth interpolation of entity facing angle (e.g. police track target while aiming)
- Logic for police reloading and magazine capacity
- Presentation with sprites (rather than geometric shapes)
- Sprite-batching to render multiple sprites with a single draw call
